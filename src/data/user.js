		description: {
			p2: "My <strong>marketing</strong> background started with a sales job at <strong>Cork Genius</strong>, where I was asked to provide my input on a potential issue. This input got me promoted to a more dynamic role. After optimizing our CRM system, I was asked to sit in on every meeting we had. Paid Search, SEO, Page Insights, etc.",
			p3: "Throughout this role, I became fascinated with connections- how the web resembled the human brain, with APIs acting as dendrites, recieving packets by means of field potentials. I dedicated all of my free time to studying and coding, and five years later was landing jobs in pure development roles.",
			p1: "My <strong>development</strong> work has primarily been packaged in the Shopify ecosystem, but I am well versed in Node, Django, and Flask backend development as well as React JS in the front-end. My coding foundation lies in Javascript, the 'language of the web'. I have taken freelance projects in web-scraper based data collection (<strong>Python</strong>), migration to Shopify (<strong>Liquid, JS, HTML, CSS</strong>), and filesystem task automation (<strong>Python, C, Bash/ZSH</strong>).",
			p4: "To this day, I have consoluted for over 10 companies and worked for 2 companies with over 10 million yearly revenue. I see Ecommerce as a team sport- building ecosystems is my passion, and I love hearing and sharing new information as the indutry evolves.",
